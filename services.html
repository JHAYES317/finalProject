  <p class="rates">$15 for 1/2 hour, $30 for 1 hour1 free trial lesson</p>
      <p class="text">I give skype lessons and accept payment through venmo or paypal. One nice thing about having an actual teacher as opposed to videos on youtube is that I can monitor your progress and check for bad habits before they become ingrained. I offer 1 free trial lesson, and if you want to learn more, then I offer lessons for the rates above. To set up lessons, email or social media direct messaging is best as I am a full time student and often am not able to return calls immediately, however, if it is urgent please feel free to leave a message and Iâ€™ll do my best to respond.</p>

  <h3 class="pricing">Pricing</h3>
  <p class="pricing">Pricing is negotiable depending on the scope of the project</p>
      <p class="text">If you want co-writes on songs you are planning on releasing or a guitar, bass, or vocal part, then I offer that service as well. Just bounce your project audio to me and I will add the desired instrument track and send it back to you. I can also quantize and organize vocal tracks as well as pitch correct instrumentation manually. If you live in the Miami or Los Angeles area, I may be able to come in person if requested. With over a decade of performing and recording experience, I believe I have the capabability to add a special something to your productions.</p>

  <h3 class="fees">Fees</h3>
  <p class="fees">Fees are negotiable depending on the gig</p>
  <p class="text">If you want a guitarist, background vocalist, or bassist to accompany you on your gig, I can provide that service as well. I have worked as a paid musician in bands and have routinely learned upwards of 20 songs on short notice as a guitarist, bassist, or as a vocalist. With over a decade of performing experience on tour and local gigs, I not only have performed with rockstars, but I have backed up solo artists such as Jesse Campbell and Eric Lumiere for one off concerts. I am based currently in Los Angeles and Miami, so those areas are preferable, though I am willing to fly to you depending on the gig. I have my own amp and pedals as well, so you won't have to have a backline.</p>
